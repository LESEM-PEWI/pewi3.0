  Press "R" to randomize the landuse tiles on the watershed. The watershed can be randomized an infinite number of times.
  Press the Esc key to go to Instructor Options, where you can turn off landuse types. By turning off Conventional Corn,
  the landuse type will no longer appear when randomized. This applies for any other landuse types that are turned off.
  Landuse types can be turned back on and put back into randomization through the Instructor Options as well.
