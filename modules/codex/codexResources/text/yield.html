<P>Yields are calculated either using existing case studies or equations tied to the Iowa Corn Suitability Rating. Yields are based on modifications to Corn Suitability Rating, determined by the CSR2 from Iowa State University. The CSR2 assigns a corn suitability rating to each soil type in Iowa, and this data is incorporated into PEWI grid cells. Yields from other crops are estimated as a proportion of corn yield values.
